## Accessing WIFI/Ethernet 

Access to the internet is fundamental. You will need an internet connection to download specific development packages for your projects.

**ETHERNET:** If possible, connect your Raspberry Pi via Ethernet. A wired connection is reliable and easy to set up. Just plug an Ethernet cable into your RPi. 

**WIFI:** Wi-Fi also works well, but **avoid Eduroam**. Eduroam networks can sometimes cause connection issues due to their security protocols. If you experience problems, try using a non-eduroam Wi-Fi network.# How To SetUp Your RP From Scratch
